# HiSchool
Android app with Kotlin for school-aged kids with phone number login using Firebase. The task is that the student can submit any file on the Firebase server (cloud) and retrieve/sync it from there from a list.

The file can be either public (which will be visible to all the users after login), and private (only visible to the user after login).
